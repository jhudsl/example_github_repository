This is an example of a GitHub repository.

### Introduction to repositories 

A repository is equivalent to the project's folder/directory - all of your version controlled files (and the recorded changes) are located in a repository. This is often shortened to repo. Repositories can be hosted on GitHub and through this interface you can either keep your repositories private and share them with select collaborators, or you can make them public - anybody can see your files and their history.

This is an example of a public repo - anybody can see these files and history.
